QID10_QuestionText,"We are thrilled to invite you to participate in the Cambridge Early Childhood Pulse Survey 2.0, the second round of an ongoing research effort led by researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. We recommend you take this survey on a computer rather than a smartphone or tablet.&nbsp;<br><br><b>What is the purpose of this research?</b><br>➘Early educators like you play a critical role in our community and broader society by supporting young children and their families. This is a research effort to understand the experiences of all educators working with young children in the City of Cambridge. Too often, research in early childhood focuses on a minority of voices in a minority of settings. Our goal is to hear from all early educators in Cambridge to understand the strengths and needs of the early education workforce so that we can help devise programs and policies that better support the important work early educators like you do!<br>➘<br>➘<b>What can I expect if I take part in this research?</b><br>➘• All early educators and <b>early education professionals (including in administrative or support roles)</b> in Cambridge working with children between birth and age five AND individuals working with children between birth and age five in <b>family support and home visiting roles</b> are eligible to participate in a one-time online survey.<br>• The survey will ask about you and your experiences working in early education. We anticipate that this survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.<br>➘• Your responses will be kept confidential and we will not link or publish your or your program’s name in this project.<br>➘• We may quote open-ended responses you provide, but your name or program will never be listed.<br>➘• You will receive a<b> $40.00 gift card for your time</b> via email in the weeks following your completion of the survey.<br>➘• It is possible that we may reach out to you in the future to participate in other related research activities. If we do, you will be provided additional information about those activities and again ask for your consent to participate.<br>➘<br>➘<b>What should I know about a research study? </b><br>➘• Whether or not you take part is up to you.<br>➘• Your participation is completely voluntary.<br>➘• You can choose not to take part.<br>➘• You can agree to take part and later change your mind.<br>➘• Your decision will not be held against you.<br>➘• Your refusal to participate will not result in any consequences or any loss of benefits that you are otherwise entitled to receive.<br>➘• You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.<br>➘<br>➘<b>Who can I talk to?</b><br>➘If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you, contact Charlotte Petty at cpetty@gse.harvard.edu.",""
