# Advent of Code 2024

This [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook has solutions to [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) challenges. It can be viewed in [Github](https://github.com/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/blob/main/aoc/aoc2024/aoc2024.ipynb) or [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/blob/main/aoc/aoc2024/aoc2024.ipynb?flush_cache=true). [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) has a helpful AoC [tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/).

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a bit different from last year. In particular&hellip;
- The data `.TXT` files used with this notebook are managed *outside* of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in the browser and must be accesed by mounting the drive with `google.colab.drive.mount`.
- Mounting the drive (with *Runtime > Run all*) from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in the browser syncs the latest `data/aoc2024??.txt` files for access by this notebook.
- Input data files in `data/aoc2024??.txt` are *not* included in this repository consistent with the [AoC about](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) page: '*If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.*'&dagger;
- Using [`git`](https://git-scm.com/doc) *outside* of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in the browser is preferable to *File > Save a copy in Github* for controlling *all* the [files](https://github.com/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/tree/main/aoc/aoc2024) with [Github](https://github.com/) and [Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
- There are some useful idioms for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) [here](https://rohitmidha23.github.io/Colab-Tricks/) (linked from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64743161/17467335)&#41;.
