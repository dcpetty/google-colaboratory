Our evening's [assignment][5] was to implement [Hamming Codes][6] (that detect and correct single-bit errors) in the TOY machine language and I thought having an *assembler* would make the assignment so much easier. So, I wrote one.\n","\n","[Lecture 18][4] makes the point that it is easy to use a computer to simulate a computer architecture and TOY has a [simple enough][7] instruction set (only 16 opcodes) that a Java version of the TOY simulator fits on one slide (`public class TOYlecture` code is embedded as a comment). I was able to adapt the Java version to Python over lunch, but completing a usable assembler by the evening's project time proved to be a longer endeavor!\n","\n","## Assembler specification\n","Any assembler must have the capability to:\n","* Generate a valid file capable of being read by the [TOY][2] simulator.\n","* Specifiy an unambiguous lexicographical representations of all instructions.\n","* Parse and tokenize a valid input line.\n","* Assemble any valid instruction.\n","    * The basic 16 opcodes:\n","<pre>HALT\n","R[A] <- R[B] + R[C]\n","R[A] <- R[B] - R[C]\n","R[A] <- R[B] & R[C]\n","R[A] <- R[B] ^ R[C]\n","R[A] <- R[B] << R[C]\n","R[A] <- R[B] >> R[C]\n","R[A] <- LABEL\n","R[A] <- M[ LABEL ]\n","M[ LABEL ] <- R[A]\n","R[A] <- M[ R[B] ]\n","M[ R[A] ] <- R[B]\n","BRANCH=0 R[A] LABEL\n","BRANCH>0 R[A] LABEL\n","JUMP R[A]\n","LINK R[A] LABEL</pre>\n","    * Shorthand references to useful instructions:\n","<pre>\n","READ R[A]       # ≡ R[A] <- M[ 0xFF ]\n","WRITE R[A]      # ≡ M[ 0xFF ] <- R[A]\n","R[A] <- R[B]    # ≡ R[A] <- R[0] + R[B]\n","GOTO LABEL      # ≡ BRANCH=0 R[0] LABEL\n","</pre>\n","    * Control structures:\n","<pre>\n"," IF<>0 R[A]      # BRANCH=0 R[A] beyond ELSE or THEN\n"," WHILE<>0 R[A]   # BRANCH=0 R[A] beyond REPEAT\n"," IF<=0 R[A]      # BRANCH>0 R[A] beyond ELSE or THEN\n"," WHILE<=0 R[A]   # BRANCH>0 R[A] beyond REPEAT\n"," ELSE            # patch IF branch to here (.) and insert BRANCH=0 R[0] beyond THEN\n"," THEN            # patch IF or ELSE branch to here (.)\n"," REPEAT          # patch WHILE branch to here (.)\n","</pre>\n","    * Memory declaration and allocation:\n","<pre>\n"," : LABEL 12      # define LABEL to have value (e.g. 12) and patch forward references\n"," : LABEL         # define LABEL to have value here (.) and patch forward references\n"," !

Any real TOY assembler would have to address these shortcomings. A list of [to-do](#todos)s is at the bottom of this cell.\n","\n","### Generate a valid file capable of being read by the TOY simulator\n","The TOY simulator file format is simple. Any line matching the regular expression `^[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:\\s[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}` represents a TOY statement. All others are ignored. The assembler generates code of this form and includes the assembler statements (including *its* comments) as a comments.\n","\n","### Specifiy an unambiguous lexicographical representations of all instructions\n","Each of the assembler's 32 valid instructions has an unambiguous lexicographical representation. Some have many variations (4096 variations on instructions with three registers or a register and an address, 256 variations on instructions with only two registers or only a label, and 16 variations on instructions with only a register).\n","\n","### Parse and tokenize a valid input line\n","Parsing and tokenizing an input line can be complicated, depending on the syntax of the assembler. *This* assembler is kept simple by the following rules:\n","* Parse every line on `'#'` to split the `line` into `code` and `comment` parts (either of which can be empty) with:\n","\n","   `line.split( '#' )[ 0 ].strip( )`.\n","\n","* Tokenize `code` on spaces into an uppercase `ops` list wtih:\n","\n","   `[ op.upper( ) for op in code.split( ' ' ) ]`.\n","\n","* Any line that does not fit the lexicographical representation of an instruction is considered a comment and prepended wtih a `'#'` if one is not already there.\n","\n","Making the parser / tokenizer split on spaces requires that instructions are, for example, expressed as five space-separated tokes (`R[2] <- M[ LABEL ]`), but the the parser / tokenizer becomes a single line of code in the assembler.\n","\n","### Assemble any valid instruction\n","There are ≈20 functions of the form `self._isSomething( self, ops )` that are responsible for determining whether the `ops` list represents a valid instruction (`somethng`). All are tested in turn and if any return `True` that instruction is assembled at the location specified by the special label `PC`. The special label `PC` is often referred to as *here* or *.* (dot) and the memory declaration and allocation instructions all use it. Once a valid instruction is assembled at *here*, the value of the special label `PC` is incremented.\n","\n","### Handle named labels with forward references\n","Useful assemblers offer the feature of named labels in code. Named labels obviate the need for code to be sprinkled with [magic numbers][8] *in lieu* of symbolic memory addresses. However, it is not always possible to know the *value* of a symbolic memory address before its *use* --- especially when such values depend on code. Such uses are [forward reference][9]s and, if they are not supported by the assembler, labeled symbolic memory addresses must be known *a priori* and become simply named magic numbers.\n","\n","> In the assembler specification, any reference to `LABEL` can be replaced by a hexadecimal number on [0x00, 0xFF]. Labels are symbolic representations of memory address and must all be declared somewhere in the program to be assembled.\n","\n","To implement forward references, any label referred to in the code is either (a) already declared and has a value, or (b) has yet to be declared and is a forward reference. The `self._labels` list contains either (a) integers, in which case the label is declared and its value is stored, or (b) lists, in which case it is the list of all memory address that must be patched to refer to the label's value once it is declared. (The TOY opcodes are relatively consistent and every instruction for which a forward reference is valid must have its lower byte patched with the value of the label once it is declared.)\n","\n","### Allow for structured code\n","In 1968 [Edsger Dijkstra][10] ushered in the era of [structured programming][11] with a letter to CACM titled [*Go To Statement Considered Harmful*][12]. Since that time, it has been useful for computer languages to offer syntactic support for alternatives (`IF-ELSE-THEN`) and iteration (`WHILE`) with specific heirarchical nesting rules that avoid '[spaghetti code][13].'\n","\n","To implement structured code:\n","\n","* When `IF` or `WHILE` is encountered, a conditional branch instruction is assembled with an empty memory address and the memory address of that instruction is pushed on the `self._control` stack.\n","* When `THEN` or `REPEAT` is encountered, the address of the instruction to patch is popped from the `self._control` stack and that instruction is patched with the current value of *here*.\n","* When `ELSE` is encountered, the behavior is equivalent to `THEN` followed by `IF`, except that an unconditional branch instruction is assembled.\n","\n","### Allow for comments, both line and end-of-line\n","If all of the functions of the form `self._isSomething( self, ops )` return `False` then the statement is saved as a comment at the memory location of the current program counter.\n","\n","### Perform assemble-time error checking\n","As with most compilers, most assemblers perform assemble-time error checking. The error checking of this assembler is minimal.\n","\n","* Invalid statements are converted to comments.\n","* The values of numbers, addresses, and lables must represent hexadecimal numbers on [0x00, 0xFF].\n","* In a `!` store label instruction, `LABEL` must be declared.\n","* After input is exhausted, all labels must be declared.\n","* After input is exhausted, control structures must be balanced.\n","> No check is made whether `ELSE` matches with `IF`, `THEN` matches with `IF` or `ELSE`, or `REPEAT` matches with `WHILE`.\n","\n","<a id='todos'>\n","<h2>To do</h2>\n","</a>\n","\n","* Improve the parser / tokenizer to not require spaces between tokens.\n","* Allow values to be saved in forward declared memory locations.\n","* Make it a syntax error if control structures do not match.\n","* Handle out-of-memory errors.\n","* Improve error reporting on syntax errors.\n","\n","[1]:http://advanced-topics.cs.princeton.edu/\n","[2]:http://lift.cs.princeton.edu/xtoy/\n","[3]:http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos126/\n","[4]:http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos126/lectures/CS.18.MachineII.pdf\n","[5]:http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos126/assignments/hamming.html\n","[6]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code\n","[7]:http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/60machine/reference.txt\n","[8]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)\n","[9]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration#Forward_reference\n","[10]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra\n","[11]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming\n","[12]:http://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf\n","[13]:http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/spaghetti-code.html"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#!/usr/bin/env python3\n","#\n","# Mount Google Drive, download remote files, and set local values.\n","#\n","# https://github.com/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/blob/main/remote-files/remote-files.ipynb\n","#\n","from os.path import join, realpath\n","dot_path = realpath('.')\n","gdrive = join(dot_path, 'gdrive')\n","notebooks = join(gdrive, 'My Drive/Colab Notebooks')\n","repo = 'toy'        # repo path within the Drive/Colab Notebooks directory\n","drive_path = join(notebooks, repo)\n","\n","# https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/v3/chapters/chap04.ipynb\n","from os.path import basename, exists\n","def download(url):\n","    filename = basename(url)\n","    if not exists(filename):\n","        from urllib.request import urlretrieve\n","        local, _ = urlretrieve(url, filename)\n","        print(\"Downloaded \" + str(local))\n","    return filename\n","\n","# Mount Google Drive for accessing files in the same direcory as this notebook.\n","# https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(gdrive)\n","# %cd drive_path   # cd so . is repo_path\n","\n","# Download remote files for accessing in the runtime directory of this notebook.\n","download('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/refs/heads/main/toy/fibonacci.asm')\n","download('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/refs/heads/main/toy/test.asm')\n","\n","# Set global variables\n","verbose = False # whether to print data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tRAr66SMzmJr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740870874585,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":26862,"user":{"displayName":"D C Petty","userId":"07097789820644360223"}},"outputId":"f1f7f3de-b419-4676-8875-8a7c3bac3999"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/gdrive\n","Downloaded fibonacci.asm\n","Downloaded test.asm\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0_22EZEMyjKo"},"source":["The `fibonacci.asm` program assembler input is:\n","\n","```\n","#################################################################\n","#\n","# Fibonacci program, loaded at location 0x40\n","#\n","GOTO START              # TOY simulator requires instruction at 0x10\n",": PC 40\n",": START\n","R[1] <- 01              # R1 <- decrement\n","R[9] <- M[ COUNT ]      # R9 <- COUNT (forward reference)\n","R[A] <- 00              # RA <- previous Fibonacci number\n","R[B] <- 01              # RB <- current Fibonacci number\n","WRITE R[B]              # send initial Fibonacci number to stdout\n","WHILE<>0 R[9]\n","    R[C] <- R[A] + R[B] # calculate next Fibonacci number\n","    R[A] <- R[B]        # shift previous Fibonacci number\n","    R[B] <- R[C]        # shift current Fibonacci number\n","    WRITE R[B]          # send current Fibonacci number to stdout\n","    R[9] <- R[9] - R[1] # decrement counter\n","REPEAT\n",": STOP\n","HALT                    # the HALT statement\n",".
