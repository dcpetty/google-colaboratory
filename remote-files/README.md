# google-colaboratory/remote-files

This is a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook that illustrates *download* code modeled after [Allen Downey](https://www.allendowney.com/wp/)'s preamble to the notebooks linked from his [books](https://www.allendowney.com/wp/books/) (*e.g.* [Think Bayes 2e](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/)) and *mount* code inspired by a [stack**overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61428443/how-to-open-and-work-on-files-stored-in-google-drive-from-google-colab/64743161#64743161) comment &mdash; posted because [Google](https://google.com/) stopped allowing notebook access to local files (in `'.'`) by default.

Use [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/blob/main/remote-files/remote-files.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dcpetty/google-colaboratory/blob/main/remote-files/remote-files.ipynb) to view it in `nbviewer`.
